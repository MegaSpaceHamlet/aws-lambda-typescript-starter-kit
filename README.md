# AWS Lambda Typescript Starter Kit

Clone the project. 

Modify project name, compiler target and so on. 

Don't forget to run `npm install`. 

The build script uses `esbuild` to bundle and minify your project. 

The zip archive will be in the `dist` folder.

`npm run test` will build the project and execute `test.js`. 

Run `git remote remove origin`, or rename it if you wish.
